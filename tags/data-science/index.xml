The following are simply my views and in no way reflect those of the whole industry.
The &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; in Data Science is supposed to refer to the fact that doing Data Science involves conducting experiments with data[0]. In any other field failed experiments are accepted, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a drug company to push out a new drug which failed internal tests, so why is it frowned upon in Data Science?</description></item><item><title>Data Science &lt;3 Clean Code</title><link>https://gabriel.gaucimaistre.com/2021/05/data-science-3-clean-code/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabriel.gaucimaistre.com/2021/05/data-science-3-clean-code/</guid><description>DISCLAIMER

I&amp;rsquo;m back with another controversial topic!
There is a common misconception among people with an academic background that being a Data Scientist means you do not need to care about writing good clean code, because you&amp;rsquo;re not a Software Developer or a Machine Learning Engineer. Data Science is all about running experiments on data and you should not need to spend your precious time worrying about making things look pretty.</description></item></channel></rss>
