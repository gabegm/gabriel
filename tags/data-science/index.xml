My talk &amp;ldquo;Geospatial Intelligence&amp;rdquo; covered a brief introduction into Geospatial data, what it looks like, its challenges, and how it can be applied towards business strategies. Some students had a few interesting questions which I thought were interesting to elaborate further on in more detail here.</description></item><item><title>On Failed Machine Learning Experiments</title><link>https://gabriel.gaucimaistre.com/2021/06/on-failed-machine-learning-experiments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabriel.gaucimaistre.com/2021/06/on-failed-machine-learning-experiments/</guid><description>The &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; in Data Science is supposed to refer to the fact that doing Data Science involves conducting experiments with data. In any other field failed experiments are accepted, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a drug company to push out a new drug which failed internal tests, so why is it frowned upon in Data Science?</description></item><item><title>Data Science &lt;3 Clean Code</title><link>https://gabriel.gaucimaistre.com/2021/05/data-science-3-clean-code/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabriel.gaucimaistre.com/2021/05/data-science-3-clean-code/</guid><description>There is a common misconception that being a Data Scientist means that you do not need to care about writing good clean code, because you&amp;rsquo;re not a Software Developer. If you&amp;rsquo;re a firm believer of this, please take some time to hear me out. I hope to have at least gotten you to reconsider by the end of this post.</description></item></channel></rss>
