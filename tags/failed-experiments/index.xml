The following are simply my views and in no way reflect those of the whole industry.
The &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; in Data Science is supposed to refer to the fact that doing Data Science involves conducting experiments with data[0]. In any other field failed experiments are accepted, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a drug company to push out a new drug which failed internal tests, so why is it frowned upon in Data Science?</description></item></channel></rss>
