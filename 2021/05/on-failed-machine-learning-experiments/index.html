In any other field failed experiments are accepted, you wouldn&rsquo;t want a drug company to push out a new drug which failed internally, so why is it frowend upon in Data Science? There is the sense in industry that a failed experiment equates to failure, thus Data Scientists are icentivised to not conduct experiments which end up in failure. This results in either Data Scientists not advertising experiments as failures and instead covering them up, or not attempting novel experiments in case they do fail.</p><p>Before we get into failed Machine Learning experiments and how they occur, we first need to cover how such experiments are cenceptualised in the first place. Normally in a data-driven company, either a Product Owner (PO) or a member of the board comes up with an application for Machine Learning within the company. This idea could have either come from having witnessed others applying Machine Learning to the same problem within their own company, or a novel idea which they came up with to try. The PO&rsquo;s job is to do some research and find out how others were able to apply this, if possible, and approach a Data Scientist to attempt the same at the company. The PO secures a big budget from the board to deliver this experiment into production.</p><p>The job of the Data Scientist is to now do more in-depth research into how Machine Learning was applied to the same problem at other companies or industries and form an understanding on how it could be applied at their company. Once the Data Scientist has achieved a thorough understand of the approach, the next step would be to attempt to recreate the experiment using the code and data from the original experiment, assuming this has been shared publically. If not, the Data Scientist must move on to formulate an experiment to try using the data of the company. Thorough analysis of the company&rsquo;s data would need to be done to look for any trends which might suggest such an Machine Learning application would be possible to attempt. At this point the Data Scientist would already have a clear understanding on whether this experiment will turn out successful or not. This is where the road for the Data Scientist now forks.</p><p>If the Data Scientist works for a company that is open to failed experiments, they will come forward and openly share the full results of the analysis thus far and express their concerns and why they think this experiment will not pan out. Depending on the receiving audience, some technical discussions might take place and this might give the Data Scientist some ideas to go back to the drawing board and try again. If the experiment cannot be replicated using the company&rsquo;s data, either because the data is not good enough, is not available to them, or does not follow the same trends, then that&rsquo;s another lesson learnt and the Data Scientist moves onto the next potential experiment.</p><p>However, if the Data Scientist works for a company that does not accept failed experiments which the Data Scientist is well aware of, they will push forward and try anything that sticks in order to not show up empty handed. The Data Scientist will present to their audience the results of the analysis which they are expecting to see and thus the experiment will be green lit to move forward.</p><p>At this point the Data Scientist knows that they will not be able reproduce the results from the experiment using the company data but will have to keep pushing forward and try anything that will work.</p><h2 id=frankenstein-machine-learning>Frankenstein Machine Learning</h2><p><img src=/images/its-alive.png alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1"></p><p>This is where things get ugly. After weeks of hacking away, the Data Scientist find some black box model that seems to perform what everyone wants. However, the Data Scientist is not able to explain what the model is doing, neither is anyone going to ask because no one wants to see this experiment fail. The results are presented to the PO or the board and this is when the results are publicised in some internal blog about how Artificial Intelligence was applied to a company problem, or some marketing post on LinkedIn.</p><p>After a while the Machine Learning model gets deployed to production and suddenly does not perform well because the model was overfitted to the train data and is now struggling with all of this out-of-sample data. At this rate either of two things happen. Either the Data Scientist comes under fire for delivering something that does not work, or no one bother to rise any concerns because again no one wants to call this a failed project.</p><h2 id=data-scientists-are-too-scared-to-try-novel-experiments-in-case-they-fail>Data Scientists are too scared to try novel experiments in case they fail</h2><p>Data Science cannot be about budgets.</p><p>Progression should not be tied to successful experiments.</p></div></main></body></html>
