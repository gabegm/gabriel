The following are simply my views on the matter and in no way reflect the views of the whole industry.

## What's a Data Science competition?

Data Science competitions are becoming extremely popular. They are not only popular on sites such as Kaggle[0] but also when interviewing with a company for a role in data. They normally consist of a time constrained objective where the organiser provides some data, many times a train and test set, dependant variable omitted from the test set of course, and submit the predictions which your model spat out in order to see how well you faired compared to all the other participants. In certain cases your methods may also be questioned, but this is more the case in job interviews rather than online competitions.

Having not only studied data science in university but also practised it in industry, I can definitely say that these are two worlds apart. This is not to say that edication doesn't have a place. My bachelor thesis revolved around algorithmic trading. I trained a Machine Learning model to pick correlated and inversely correlated stocks from a basket, forecast future price movements in said stocks, and decide on whether to hold, buy, or sell based on those insights without the need of any human input. Although I did learn a lot from this experience, I would definitely not use the model in industry and I would absolutely not let it use real money to invest.

## Industry isn't about producing the highest fraction of accuracy

Is your model robust?

Do you understand the data?

Do you understand what your model is learning from the data?

Not all submissions are required to submit code

You are not required to write good clean code

Someone already did the work to package the data for you

## How to improve your Data Science skills

Scrape data or find an API

Continuously gather data

What Kaggle is good for

Getting ideas from other submissions (if they submitted code) to try on your own data

Knowledge sharing

Asking the submitter (again if they submitted code) questions
