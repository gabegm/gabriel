When many people hear the term "data privacy", their first counter is that they have nothing to hide. Although this could make sense at face value, once you dive deep into the things which are smartphones are tracking about us, one will quickly jump to the conclusion that this statement does not hold an ounce of water.



No one sane would ever want their relatives, friends, work colleagues, and neighbors to be able to know (quoting from the OP):

> who you sleep with because both you and the person you share your bed with keep your phones nearby

> whether you sleep soundly at night or whether your troubles are keeping you up

> whether you pick up your phone in the middle of the night and search for things like "loan repayment"

> your IQ based on the pages you "like" on Facebook and the friends you have

> your restaurant visits and shopping habits

> how fast you drive, even if you don't have a smart car, because your phone contains an accelerometer

> your life expectancy based on how fast you walk, as measured by your phone

> whether you suffer from depression by how you slide your finger across your phoneâ€™s screen

> if your spouse is considering leaving you because she's been searching online for a divorce lawyer
