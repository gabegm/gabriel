      <description>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into effect on the 25th of May, 2018; along with it a number of penalties for companies who fail to abide by these rules. These penalties can be very harsh, up to €20M or 4% of your company’s annual worldwide revenue. The European Commission (EC) has stated that no exceptions will be made after the 25th of May, and failure to comply will result in hefty fines. Despite these harsh penalties, not all companies are taking this new regulation seriously who will no doubt find themselves in a world of panic just before GDPR hits. Many more fail to understand the point of this new regulation and what it swears to protect. In light of this, I thought I’d give a brief overview of this new regulation and what it entails.</description>
